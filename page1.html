        <p> Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and 
        complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending 
        act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. What's 
        the name, Tool? "In a 1994 interview, legendary drummer Danny Carey says that the band's name 
        stands for how they want their music to be a "tool" to aid in understanding 
        lachrymology."  <i>Lachrymology</i>, founded in the 1940s by Ronald P. Vincent, 
        translates literally to 'the study of crying'."</p>
